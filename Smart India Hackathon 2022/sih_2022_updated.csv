"Department of Space, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).",Prediction of TEC variations with Artificial Intelligence using Space Weather Data as input,"The ionospheric electron density is sensitive to the space weather parameters like Sunspot numbers, F10.7, Interplanetary magnetic field etc. and shows variation with respect to them. These parameters are detected and measured at L1 point (currently by ESA / NASA satellites) and are transmitted to earth. So, the information about these parameters are available before they actually influence the terrestrial ionosphere. Importantly, all these data are freely available over internet. The abovementioned parameters affect the ionospheric TEC, which in turn shows abrupt variations and deviations from the nominal characteristics. Therefore, these unconventionalities, which are typically observed during solar and geomagnetic storms, are necessary to be identified. This is also important, because the performance of the GNSS system, which is currently driving millions of applications, are also affected by the ionospheric variabilities. So, prediction of the TEC provides a handle to take necessary actions to avoid or mitigate the resultant impairments arising out of the above facts. For the purpose, the time sequence of space-weather parameters, along with the local time, location, season, date etc. can be related to the same for the vertical TEC and a definitive relationship can be established using Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, like neural networks or other deep learning algorithms. Once trained with known dataset, the AI based algorithm may be able to predict the expected TEC variations which can be used by the concerned users. The schematic for the approach may be as the following. The problem requires the development of the proper AI algorithm to use the available space weather and other data to predict the TEC variations at one particular location on the earth, preferably over the geomagnetic equator.

But to remember so difficult passwords and that too on numerous websites seems daunting and therefore you can devise a project illustrating graphical password strategy. This will allow the user to set passwords in the form of graphical presentation in a certain pattern and later use that pattern to login o the system. Summary: Remembering numerous passwords from various different sites can be difficult for a user. So to provide some flexibility we can provide users a graphical password authentication system where instead of creating a password a user has to select graphical objects in a particular order to keep it as their password. Objective: : In this method, the user is required to select some images (let’s say different chocolates) in a specific pattern (for example dairy milk is followed by 5 stars which is in turn followed by KitKat and so on). Next time the user tries to log in, the images would have been shuffled, but the user will be required to follow the same pattern which was used initially. Every time the user will have to use the same sequence while the images are placed in different ways.

All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).,Lack of sustainability in appointment of Faculty in Higher Educational Institutions and Colleges,"""Background: Retirement of faculties and appointment of faculties in colleges is not standardised in our country. While retirements are mandatory on superannuation, steps to fill up the vacancy that arises immediately is lacking. When a vacancy arises in the middle of the academic year on account of the superannuation of a faculty, the students are the victims. There should be state or National registry or databank to assess the actual faculty requirement college-wise keeping in view the date of retirement and number of teachers who retire, so that recruitment process can start well in advance and the faculty is readily available as soon as a faculty retires. Standard of education in India cannot be improved unless we fill all the vacancies every year selecting suitable candidates. Summary: Faculty’s appointment in colleges tend to be slow in our country when there is an immediate need of faculty. This happens because in so short notice it is impossible to get a faculty for the college. This problem makes the students victim where they lack behind in their academics. Addressing this problem can help in appointing faculties in a very roburst process. Objective: : We need you to create an app which will indicate the future vacancies and positions so that proper planning of recruitment is possible. All the data of faculties who are retiring or leaving the institute should be updated in the app and simultaneously find out faculties for that position who are ready to join.

Coal India Limited,Development of VR / AR (Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality) based application to train and up-skill the workforce involved in safely executing high risk tasks and problem solving key operational challenges in Coal mining industry.,"""Background: The mining industry is known worldwide for its highly risky and hazardous working environment. Technological advancement in extraction techniques for proliferation of production levels has caused further concern for safety in this industry. Research so far in the area of safety has revealed that the majority of incidents in this hazardous industry take place because of human error, the control of which would enhance safety levels in working sites to a considerable extent. India is the world's second-largest coal producer as of 2021. Coal production in the country stood at 715.95 million tons (MT) in FY21. Between April 2021 and October 2021, coal production in India stood at 379.597 million tons (MT). Coal is the main pillar of India’s energy sector. In 2021, it said, India consumed 93.2 crore tons of coal, 77% of which came from domestic production and 90% of which was used for power generation. The National Foundation of India study said that crores of Indians depend on the coal economy directly or indirectly. It highlighted that more than 1.3 crore Indians are employed in coal mining, transport, power, sponge iron, steel and bricks sectors. According to studies, skill-based errors are most critical and require immediate attention for mitigation. Training and upskilling the work force can help avoid errors which are based on mostly based on predictive fuzzy reasoning. Summary: VR technology has its unique advantages in several fields related to coal mining, such as miner safety training and emergency rescue drilling, besides drifting-producing process simulation, disaster scenario simulation, and mechanical operation training. Coal mining, regarded as a high-risk industry, has a strong demand for virtual reality (VR) to fulfill safety and emergency rescue training. A cloud-based VR system is to be designed for the training of coal miners. This system has to be a browser/client architecture which will include modules demonstrating the full procedure of an underground coal mine. The online cloud-rendered video streaming is to be adopted to provide enough computing and rendering power for a better browser-based user experience. Furthermore, game artificial intelligence (AI) can also be introduced into the system to increase the emotional exchange between the system and users. Objective: The objective is to provide an AR/VR solution that can simulate the real life situations and challenges of the coal mining industry and the workers can be trained and can be given the first-hand experience and possible solution to tackle such a scenario which will help avoid mishappenings and could save dozens of lives.""",Software,NC737,19,Miscellaneous

Coal India Limited,Prototype of a Solar Powered IOT Device with the ability to connect to a smart network to be used in Geo Tagging of Physical Assets Created under CSR,"""Background: In 2014, India became the second country in the world (after Mauritius) to mandate spend on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) by introducing specific provisions through Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 (CA 2013). The new law required companies to spend in a given financial year, at-least two percent of their average net profits earned over the preceding three financial years subject to satisfying certain qualifying conditions. The Board of Directors were required to explain reasons for underspend, if any, in the company’s Annual Report. Over the years, these provisions underwent changes and more recently, with an objective to reinforce compliance, anti-abuse and strengthen governance, transparency and flexibility, the MCA has introduced significant changes through the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2020 and the Companies (Corporate Social Responsibility Policy) Amendment Rules, 2021 to amend the CA 2013 and its related rules. The amended rules became effective from 22 January 2021 and require close review as they directly impact implementation of a company’s CSR initiatives and also introduce new concepts like a specific negative list in the CSR definition, mandatory treatment of CSR underspend, mandatory impact assessment, mandatory registration by NGOs undertaking CSR activities, etc. These changes are likely to trigger impact across regulatory, accounting, finance and tax domains. Coal mining industry is not a clean industry and there is a need for balancing between the development opportunities provided by the industry and its environmental as well as social impacts. In response to the international call for sustainable development, integration of CSR measures in core operations of all business companies in India has been made mandatory and most of the companies claim compliance of the statute. The Indian coal mining industry has been making substantial expenditure and effort towards CSR initiatives since years in order to meet the legal requirements and international expectations. A study was required to analyze as to what extent CSR initiatives of the industry contribute to sustainable development, i.e. to what extent the use of natural resources and the environment is possible, given the current level of economic activity; what responsibilities the industry should bear in order to achieve sustainable development goals on its part and how far it has gone adopting CSR initiatives. Currently there is no mechanism to monitor the progress of a coal mining CSR project on a real time basis. Summary: Since the Corporate social investment can help businesses build a reputation as a responsible business, which in turn, lead to competitive advantage. Corporates sometime may take undue advantage of CSR projects to save taxes, attract investments, media attention, forge relations with local authorities to turn the bids in their favor etc. by announcing a big fund or categorizing a project under CSR. Amended CSR rules has cast enhanced obligation on the Board, CSR Committee and Chief Financial Officer of the Company for monitoring, evaluation and reporting of CSR activities of the Company. In light of the detailed requirements, a Company needs to assess and put in place, suitable mechanisms to collate the data required for disclosures. Also, an evaluation of the completeness of financial disclosures in the Annual Report is required CSR Rules mandatorily require impact assessment report to be placed before the Board and the reports to be annexed to the Annual Report on CSR. Companies should evaluate whether the full impact assessment report should be annexed to the report or an abridged version could be appended, with a reference to the Company’s website, if any, where the detailed report shall be hosted or provide details of a designated person who could be contacted for the full report, in case the Company does not maintain a website. Objective: To give a software and a hardware solution that can identify, track and monitor the progress of the project on a real time basis.

Coal India Limited,Moving vehicle registration plate detection,"""Background: Mining operations are generally spread over a vast area in remote locations and harsh environments. Coal extraction is a high cost and increasingly high technology venture that requires the utmost operational efficiency as well as uninterrupted workflow and delivery cycles. Operations cannot afford to be impacted due to lack of visibility as to the location and status of machinery, equipment and vehicles, since this causes delays, increased cost and mounting losses and is also an open invitation to theft and misuse. Real-time location tracking and monitoring, especially of moveable assets such as the vehicle fleet transporting the coal, is thus of critical importance to the mining industry. Tracking pickups and deliveries of thousands of truck-loads moving daily to and from various locations inside mining areas to processing plants, rail wagons or jetties is a logistics nightmare. Moving vehicle registration plate detection: RFID is fitted with vehicles moving across the mining region. The RFIDs are mapped to their respective registration number. It happens that two vehicles may exchange registration plates for malicious purpose including theft or forgery. A system is to be created to extract registration number from number plate of moving vehicle. The data captured should be transferred to cloud environment which can be available for further analysis of theft or proof reading. Summary: In general, most companies employ an active (battery-powered) radio frequency identification system to track trucks entering and leaving a mine with a load. This can be accomplished via a real-time location system (RTLS) if there are vehicles parked that need to be located quickly. But more commonly, an active RFID transponder is affixed to a vehicle, with readers set up at various points—at a mine’s entry gate, at a weigh station, at an exit and so forth. Software tracks the truck’s location, and you can usually run a variety of reports. The best solution really depends on the type of information that you would like to collect and use. Objective: To create an anti-theft auto security system that can extract registration number from number plate of moving vehicle. And can capture and transfer data to cloud, which can be available for further analysis of theft or proof reading.""",Software,NC740,114,Transportation & Logistics
Coal India Limited,A system of IoT devices to measure load weight in a dumper,"""Background: When the causes of fatal accident in coal mines are analyzed for the last 43 years since nationalization of coal mines, it is clearly observed that there are five major causes, such as Ground movement, Fall other than fall of ground, Transportation machinery (other than winding), machinery other than transportation machinery and explosives which contributes almost 91% of the total accident. That is why we divided the cause of the accident into five groups and rest of causes are in one group. Accidents due to ground movement contributed 41%, transportation of machinery (other than winding in shaft) contributing 31% along with Machinery Other than Transportation Machinery, Explosive and Fall (other than the fall of Ground) which contributed 6%, 4% and 9% respectively. When the last thirty-three years of fatal accident due to dumper and wheeled trackless transportation (truck, tractor, tanker) machinery data of Indian coal mining industry was further analyzed, an average number of accidents due to trackless transportation machinery (wheeled) came out to be quite high ranging from 47.2 to 28.3 per year. In Coal mining a dumper is loaded with Coal and then transported to specific location. Many such dumpers does not have load cells to measure the loaded quantity. Summary: In Coal mining a dumper is loaded with Coal and then transported to specific location. Many such dumpers do not have load cells to measure the loaded quantity. To make money, transporters prefer carrying more than the prescribed quantity of coal in their vehicles. Overloading exceeds the load rating of tires and braking system on a dump truck and extends the total stopping distance of the vehicle. In an emergency braking scenario, brakes get hot quickly and lose their effectiveness. Hence increasing the chances of accidents resulting in fatalities. Routine and regular overloading increases the wear and tear on structural, steering, chassis and suspension components which leads to a less than reliable hydraulic system. When drivers attempt to lift the dump bed, the hydraulic ram isn’t strong enough to lift the load. When the truck is parked on an angle, the additional weight of an overloaded dump bed causes the truck to tip to the side. Many a times overloading causes the truck to skid, resulting in a head-on crash or rollover incident. An overloaded truck is much harder to control during an off-the-road recovery. Objective: The object is to provide a solution to measure the load weight of the dumper using IoT technology. The solution should give dynamic measurements based of coal loaded into the dumper which will help stop overloading of the dumper and hence mitigate the risks of fatal accidents.""",Software,NC741,32,Transportation & Logistics
Ministry of Consumer Affairs,Smart Buffer Stock Solution,"""Background: In 2017, the government was struggling to keep prices of the essential vegetable affordable as retail prices had crossed Rs 60 per kg in Delhi. Then Union Food Minister had expressed his helplessness in controlling onion prices and blamed reduction in the area of cultivation and hoarding by traders for the shortage. The government was forced to take measures such as procuring onions from local markets and discouraging exports to bring the prices down. In order to keep a watch on the hoarders, the government has roped in various agencies to keep a check on the hoarding activities over the period of time. Also, with predictions of a """"below average"""" monsoon in the year 2019, the Central government asked procurement agencies to store at least 50,000 tons of onions to ensure that market prices remain under control in case of shortage. The buffer stock would be used to control prices in case there is a shortage of onions in the market. Fluctuating weather and decreasing monsoon, causes decrease in crop (onion) output which in turn creates a demand supply gap hence leading to increase in prices or inflation. Summary: Reports from across the country indicate there has been an unnatural spike in the prices of vegetables, disrupting the carefully planned kitchen budgets of millions. An all-India survey on the retail price of vegetables like onions and tomatoes between November 18 and 28 showed that most households in big tier-1 cities forked out around Rs 100 for a kilo, while the average payout in tier-2 and tier-3 cities was Rs 80 per kg. Even the prices of sturdier staple vegetable—potato are up about 20%. Unseasonal rains all over the country have ruined vegetable crops and disrupted market operations, creating a shortage. High diesel prices too have added to the woes of consumers as they bear the increased transport costs. The crash and spurt in prices of these essential veggies has unfortunately become an acceptable cycle. For instance, last year saw a high in onion prices in September and a huge spurt again was witnessed this February on account of unseasonal rains. Then followed a sudden spurt in production by mid-March triggering a 30-40% fall in prices. In Lasalgaon, India’s onion hub, farmers were in tears as prices crashed from Rs 4,000 a quintal to a low of Rs 2,500. The government had to take last-minute measures like banning onion exports as soon as prices soar. One of the reasons prices of potatoes are relatively stable compared to other vegetables is because they use 90% of the warehousing cold storage space and do not rot easily. Similar cold chain/ storage infrastructure for other important veggies, with central support, will give better returns to farmers and provide stable prices to consumers. The more perishable onions and tomatoes can be processed and stored, as is done in many advanced countries. Objective: The Department wishes to create buffer stock of onions in the harvest season and keep the buffer stock intact with its food value, moisture and taste for at least a period of six months from date of storage. We would want the technical solution to be proposed for the following:- (a (a) Storage of onions in the traditional storage systems and warehouses available in the country. (b) Technical solutions for storage of onions in temperature controlled storage systems, warehouses.""",Hardware,VM742,40,"Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development"

The physical movement of such files/ documents has many disadvantages. When a document file is under process of approval, the location of the file document where it has been delayed on the way while moving from table to table, is very difficult to trace. The status of a document/ file which has been initiated is not traceable until it returns back to the parent section/ Office. During physical movement of files, there is every chance of missing files. Due to natural disasters or mistakes on an individual level, files/ documents may get damaged. There is a possibility of tampering of documents even after the same has been approved/ closed. There is wastage of huge amounts of paper and printing expenses. This procedure also requires attendants/ peons/ MTS personnel for the physical movement of files. It requires huge space for storing files/record keeping. Objective: Formulation of a common file/document movement procedure, which can be customized to suit the systems in different departments/sections and Institutions. Development of a web-based integrated platform for creation, forwarding, rejection/ approval of documents/ files in electronic format with facilities for making sketches, attaching external reference files etc. Customization facility to define the file movement procedure and nomination of designated Officers/ sections.

Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR).,Digital infrastructure and a robust and smart Document Management System (DMS),"""For the next Smart India Hackathon initiative of Education Ministry in Government of India, the Indian Council for Cultural Relations is likely to pose a challenge “How to make ICCR a paperless organization within one year?” to the potential hackathoners. The idea behind this challenge is to find the mother of all solutions to the multiple problems being faced by a government organization such as ICCR by adopting a Paperless Strategy under which ICCR will no longer issue or ask for paper documents across all of its internal and external operations. If achieved, this will not only make ICCR a fully paperless organization (the first one in GOI to embark on a path where 100 % of its internal processes and external interactions will be done digitally), but this will also eliminate the need of usinga significant quantity of paper in itsworking every year. The solution that ICCR is looking for is much more than the e-Office solution being provided by NIC, whose vision is to achieve a simplified, responsive, effective and transparent working of all Government Offices, but not to target a 100% paperless government or organization. The 6 features of the e-Office of NIC viz. SPARROW, eFile, KMS, PIMS, eTour and eLeave do not even try to help a government organization to go 100% paper-free.ICCR intends to embark on a journey to find the necessary technology and implement it within its organization to enable paper-free transactions. In case the hackathoners, during the next Smart India Hackathon 2022, are able to find an intelligent, lasting solution to this challenge in terms of suggesting a digital infrastructure and a robust and smart Document Management System (DMS) required for making ICCR a first Government of India organization to go paper-free by 31st December 2022, it would enable ICCR in becoming a smarter, faster, more transparent and thus, more accountable and more result-oriented as opposed to process-oriented organization. This “Mother of All Solutions” to most bureaucratic problems will thus set ICCR apart from other GOI organizations by helping it become a complete, round and mobile organization, in addition to, making it the first total paper-free, environment-friendly organization. ICCR does aspire to become an organization that wants to include India’s scientific temper, indigenous technology, innovation and Indian enterprise as essential parts of our Indian culture in its arsenal of soft power projection capabilities abroad. Moreover, the pandemic is making us realize how important the digital space has become and how much the requirement of physicality in Business Operations has shrunk. As a brief backgrounder, ICCR was set up in 1950 by Government of India to promote cultural relations between India and other countries. ICCR has the sanctioned strength of 207 officials and staff, has 38 Indian Cultural Centres abroad and 18 Regional Offices in India. ICCR organizes various cultural activities in India as well as abroad. The activities organized by ICCR during the last financial year 2020-21 can be seen in its Annual Report 2020-21 by scanning the QR code below.""",Software,RK795,8,Smart Automation

"Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), Ministry of Jal Shakti",Standalone Desktop application for pumping test data analysis,"CGWB suggests developing a standalone desktop application for analysis and interpretation of pumping test data which can be distributed as freeware for use by ground water professionals, researchers, students, teachers and others Considering the pivotal role of groundwater in the world’s water supply and its gradual depletion coupled with growing contamination, there is an urgent need to investigate the reaction of aquifers to various human activities in terms of both quantity and quality of groundwater so as to avoid severe and often irreversible damages to the mankind and ecosystem. To achieve this broad goal, a prior knowledge of the hydraulic properties of different aquifer systems is a basic necessity for almost all groundwater-related studies. The pumping test (or ‘aquifer performance test’) is the standard and most widely used method for determining the hydraulic parameters of aquifers. Pumping tests are conducted on a large scale by CGWB, State Groundwater Departments, and other Groundwater agencies for estimating the hydraulic characters of water bearing layers. Various aquifer parameters such as Transmissivity, Storativity, Specific Yield can be estimated using pumping test. Analysis and interpretation of pumping test data is a tedious process and is usually done using computer applications. However, there are no Indian software available for this purpose. Central Ground Water Board proposes to develop standalone desktop application for analysis and interpretation of pumping test data which can be distributed as freeware for use by ground water professionals, researchers, students, teachers and others. Data Source: Professionals using the software application will enter the data. The user can chose to enter the data directly using forms or import it from existing data sources. Expected Outcome: A standalone desktop application for analysis and interpretation of pumping test data. Modules for interpretation involving standard methods like Theiss, Theiss recovery and Jacob methods can be made part of the software application. Innovative approach may be attempted to: Design the most complete set of tools for aquifer test data input, analysis, visualization, interpretation and reporting.",Software,BV798,4,Smart Automation
"National Water Mission (NWM), Ministry of Jal Shakti",Use of Digital Technology in addressing Non-Revenue Water (NRW),"With ever-increasing urban population growth and expanding area coverage, many water utilities in India struggling to provide clean drinking water to their consumers. Water supply issues are related to sources and usage of raw water; intermittent water supply and the quality of tap water at the consumers’ end. One of the major challenge facing is the high level of water loss in distribution networks. “Non-Revenue Water” (NRW) is defined as the difference between the amount of water put into the distribution system and the amount of water recovered from consumers. NRW is a good indicator for water utility performance; high levels of NRW typically indicate a poorly managed water utility. In addition, available NRW data are often found problematic, suspicious, inaccurate, or provide only partial information. Despite of knowing the benefits of reducing NRW, decades of effort have not delivered much improvement in India. Lack of support for comprehensive NRW management by 691788/2021/e-Governance Section 20/30 2 utility owners and chief executive officers makes it difficult to motivate utility staff and provide them with the means (funding, training, and technology) to successfully and sustainably reduce NRW. Hence, there is a need to develop a system or technology to trace and tackle non-revenue water and convert it into revenue water using digital methods. This will save water as well as increase profitability and improves the return on investment w.r.t water distribution networks.",Software,BV799,10,Smart Automation

Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,Suggest a solution to predict the local impact of urban flooding in major cities.,"Urban flooding is significantly different from rural flooding as urbanization leads to developed catchments, which increases the flood peaks from 1.8 to 8 times and flood volumes by up to 6 times. Consequently, flooding occurs very quickly due to faster flow times (in a matter of minutes). Urban areas are densely populated and people living in vulnerable areas suffer due to flooding, sometimes resulting in loss of life. It is not only the event of flooding but the secondary effect of exposure to infection also has its toll in terms of human suffering, loss of livelihood and, in extreme cases, loss of life.Increasing trend of urban flooding is a universal phenomenon and poses a great challenge to urban planners the world over. Predicting the extent of calamity requires lots of parameters like rainfall, vegetation etc. Improper disposal of solid waste, including domestic, commercial and industrial waste and dumping of construction debris into the drains also contributes significantly to reducing their capacities. It is imperative to take better operations and maintenance actions.The main objective of this problem is to help the city managers or urban residents in for predicting the impact of urban flooding and can help them to take preventive action.",Software,BV802,8,Miscellaneous
Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,Suggest a solution to help the ULBs/State/UT Governments to monitor or control the growth of slums in the country and develop a self-sustained environment to ensure affordable housing in order to avoid growth of slums in future.,"Slums have posed a huge problem for development because they are by definition areas in which the inhabitants lack fundamental resources and capabilities such as adequate sanitation, improved water supply, durable housing or adequate living space. Many governments have tried to find solutions to the problem, and one of the proposed solutions is slum upgrading. Slum upgrading is essentially a strategy in which the infrastructure of a slum is improved, such as giving adequate water supply and sewage to the community. Additionally, because of the tenuous legal status of slum inhabitants, often strategies include the legalization of the right to the land on which slums are built.Slum improvement has been a challenge for the country. Poverty, unavailability of urban land for building affordable housing, paucity of data leads to rise in slums in the country. In order to make our country healthy, inclusive and prosperous a strong approach is needed for the redevelopment of slums. Technology can play a major role in meeting the shortcomings of the data, monitoring and controlling the spread of epidemic etc. and regularise the slum settlement.This problem aims for an innovative approach for the redevelopment of the slum areas in order to avoid growth of slums in future and a technical solution to monitor and control the growth of slums in present time.",Software,BV803,23,"Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development"

Solid Waste Management is of critical concern and needs attention. Whereas many developed countries are searching for ready-made sustainable waste management solutions. The solid wastes have become a major consequence of development, modernization and urbanization. Solid waste includes useless, unwanted, discharged materials that is not liquid or gas. The solid waste affects the natural environment to a great extent and pose a serious threat as these materials remain in one particular place or a relatively longer period of time unless removed, burned or washed away. In this respect, solid waste has been identified as significant matter for sustainable development. Growth in population and change in lifestyle has led to an increase in solid waste generation. Both the residential and commercial waste are in solid or semi solid form. Safe and cost-effective solid waste management is a great challenge for the modern society. It is estimated that 40% of the waste remains uncollected.This research aims for a technical solution for the management of solid wastes by providing visibility on city sanitation, route planning for garbage collection, resource optimization, air quality measurements, visibility of bins in order to maximize the waste collection.",Software,BV805,63,Clean & Green Technology
Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,Suggest a redefined solution to help cities locate EV(Electric Vehicles) charging infrastructure.,"It’s hard to pinpoint the invention of the electric car to one inventor or country. Instead it was a series of breakthroughs -- from the battery to the electric motor -- in the 1800s that led to the first electric vehicle on the road. In the early part of the century, innovators in Hungary, the Netherlands and the United States -- including a blacksmith from Vermont -- began toying with the concept of a battery-powered vehicle and created some of the first small-scale electric cars. And while Robert Anderson, a British inventor, developed the first crude electric carriage around this same time, it wasn’t until the second half of the 19th century that French and English inventors built some of the first practical electric cars. Here in the U.S., the first successful electric car made its debut around 1890 thanks to William Morrison, a chemist who lived in Des Moines, Iowa. His six-passenger vehicle capable of a top speed of 14 miles per hour was little more than an electrified wagon, but it helped spark interest in electric vehicles.Under the EV rollout plan the power ministry is targeting 4 billion plus population cities under the EV policy initiative. The success of EV adoption hinges upon successful deployment of EV charging infrastructure. Location analysis for EV charging stations helps optimize utilisation and maximize benefits that include the number of EVs in the area and grid infrastructure.

Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,Suggest a solution to ensure that the demand for public transport resonates with the stretched peak hours to ensure uniform demand during these hours.,"Before the Covid-19 crisis, the public transport sector saw opportunities to explore novel approaches to boost ridership around the world. However, more people on the transport network presented issues such as overcrowding, pressure on the public transport infrastructure and the subsequent poor quality of service. Then, around late 2019 - early 2020, an outbreak of the Covid-19 virus was deemed a pandemic, forcing most countries into a complete lockdown for a few months. Imposing physical distancing on public transport vehicles is unrealistic in the long-term for obvious reasons. The urgent need to create safe spaces for both passengers and transport workers while restoring faith in mass transport has provided an exceptional incentive for our solution: Moving towards a different time schedule for some economic and social activities to distribute peak commute hours and better manage the demand in public transport networks.The current COVID situation has pulled people back to the personalized modes of transport which would lead to further worsening of traffic congestion issues along with the financial stress for the public transport companies for maintaining the regular operations.

Due to the stockpiling of gloves, gowns, masks and other protective clothing and equipment, there appears to be a waste emergency due to the unusual production of waste from both households and health facilities. Failure to properly manage the waste generated from health facilities and households may escalate the spread of COVID-19 via secondary transmission. The potential rampant dumping, open burning and incineration could affect air quality and health outcomes due to the exposure to toxins. The COVID pandemic has brought with it adversities with many dimensions, on such dimension is the improper and unscientific disposal of personal protection equipment such as masks, plastic body covers, face shields etc. This is putting an additional strain on the city authorities, who were already grappling with single use plastic menace. Thus, there exists a challenge of managing unusual waste sustainably using available waste facilities while reducing air pollution, preventing secondary viral transmission and mitigating potential health risk .

Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,Suggest an innovative approach to serve the educational needs of the weaker section of the society during this challenging situation of COVID-19.,"The COVID-19 Pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the near-total closures of schools, early childhood education and care (ECEC) services, universities and colleges. Most governments decided to temporarily close educational institutions in an attempt to reduce the spread of COVID-19. New online programs have shifted the labour of education from schools to families and individuals, and consequently, people everywhere who relied on schools rather than computers and home life have had more difficulty accessing their education. The impact was more severe for disadvantaged children and their families, causing interrupted learning, compromised nutrition, childcare problems, and consequent economic cost to families who could not work. In response to school closures, UNESCO recommended the use of distance learning programmes open educational applications and platforms that schools and teachers can use to reach learners remotely and limit the disruption of education.Smart classrooms has been an extremely innovative idea in improving the ways of educating the newer generation. However, with the onset of COVID, the very premise of school education has gone for a toss. Many schools have come up with technological solutions for distance learning and several online education platforms have been offering plethora of courses at premium prices. Although, the affluent classes of the society may choose to opt from these options but the economically weaker section have nothing affordable for their children.The main objective of this research is to develop an effective way to provide education to the economically weaker sections of the country during these challenging times of COVID-19.",Software,BV811,13,Miscellaneous
Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,Suggest effective solutions that would attract commuters to use Public Transport in large scale during this Pandemic situation.,"Public transportation systems include a variety of transit options such as buses, light rail, and subways. These systems are available to the general public, may require a fare, and run at scheduled times. The purpose of introducing or expanding public transportation is to increase access to and use of public transit while, at the same time, reducing motor vehicle miles driven and traffic congestion. Public transportation is one of the essential services operating during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This pandemic and related restrictions led to major transit demand decline for many public transit systems.The (COVID-19) pandemic had a large impact on Public transport. Many countries advised that public transport should only be used when essential; passenger numbers fell drastically, and services were reduced. Provision of a reasonable service for the much smaller number of fare-paying passengers incurred large financial losses. Researchers investigate for safe ways of public transport during the COVID-19 pandemic. A study finds that mandatory face masks and social distancing can allow for relatively safe public transport.

Key obstacles to inclusive approaches to street vending management in cities are the perceptions and misconceptions of the role that street vendors play. Informed by and responding to the common set of arguments used to exclude street vendors.Street vendors may contribute to congestion and grime but so do pedestrians, vehicles, the general public – and city governments that fail to regulate traf?c and provide sanitation services. While informally traded food and drink can pose public health risks, vendors would welcome more hygienic working conditions to attract customers and to ensure the safety of their goods. Moreover, where public sanitation services are not available, vendors often clean their areas of operation. In many cities, street vendors self-monitor and self-manage their vending sites to reduce congestion, crime, grime, and public health risks. Even after all these things they have to compromise on the Urban design and face a lot of things.The main objective of this task is to help the street vendors to get included in the public space development without compromising on the urban designing.Students are expected to suggest more improvised and redefined solution for conserving and reusing the rain water and reduce the water demand at source.",Software,BV813,18,"Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development"

And then, using different diversion tactics, water would be stored and used for drinking, washing, agriculture and more. There began to be issues with the historic way of collecting rain. As civilizations grew, the cisterns would become more and more contaminated. This lead to the spreading of diseases since the modern technology was not available to remove bacteria. As countries became more developed, centralized water utilities began to sprout and became the primary source for all water needs.The age of rainwater harvesting has not reached its peak. Many farms continued to use rainwater cisterns for feeding livestock.

Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,Suggest an innovative approach for redeveloping the centralized sewage treatment plants and help the city managers to better adopt decentralized approaches and ensure water resources through reuse.,"""Centralized wastewater systems are the most widely applied in well-developed urban environments and the oldest approach to the solution of the problems associated with wastewater. They collect wastewater in large and bulk pipeline networks, also referred as sewerage which transport it at long distances to one or several treatment plants. Storm water can be collected in either combined sewers or in a separate storm water drains. The latter consists of two separate pipeline systems, one for the wastewater and one for the storm water. The treated effluent is disposed in different ways, most often discharged into natural water bodies. The treated effluent may also be used for beneficial purposes and in this case it is referred as reclaimed water. The main difference between decentralized and centralized systems is in the conveyance structure. In decentralized systems the treatment and disposal or reuse of the effluent is close to the source of generation. This results in a small conveyance network, in some cases limited only to one pipeline. The size of the network allows for applications of different conveyance methods, in addition to the well-known gravity sewers, such as pressurized sewers and vacuum sewers. The quantity of the effluent is low and is characterized by significant fluctuations.Across pan India Mega/Metro cities are maintaining the centralised sewerage treatment plants but most of the treatment plants could not attains its threshold limits always, either it is under or over loaded.

Oil Spills do not occur instataneously. There are events e.g. machinary malfunction that lead to such disasters. Before a spill occurs the crew might be well aware of the challenging situation and often spend time in avoiding such an event. During such times, the ship movement behavior may change from its normal pattern i.e. travelling at a predicted speed towards the port of call. At present, however there is no mechanism that can look into such patterns and predict a potential spill event to mitigate it in timely manner. While the tankers have AIS and the systems are 'on', only predictive models can help flag unusual behavior that need to be monitored.

Even for fossil fuel-rich countries, climate sensitivity and targets are motivation to switch to alternate energy resources such as solar power. This ratio is poised to get further improve due to rollout of electric vehicles. Solar power genertaion capacity of a country depends on many factors. Since Asian countries such as India and ASEAN are within tropics, the day length is not a major concern for any part of the year. With governments facilitating rooftop solar model within the grids, gigentic areas for solar panel installation aren't mendatory. This leaves the air quality (haze) that determines what wavelengths and intensity of sunlight is received at ground level. Air pollutants have many sources, natural as well as anthropogenic. For both, the source need not to be near same place or even country. Massive duststorms or wildfires have been known to spread the haze across the continent. Due to solar power installation being at the base of it's exponential, it is not yet clear if and at what scale the air quality impacts on solar power generation.

Street lighting also improves safety for drivers, riders, and pedestrians on rural roads, where the road conditions are sometimes not of the desired standards. Streetlights have been installed in many villages and state highways in Central India. However, many times these lights remain non- functional due to late information about the exact location and unavailability of sufficient service support. Consequently, in the absence of proper lighting, some of these areas become unsafe for people at night especially elders, women, and children. An automated feedback system based on a software may allow the service engineers to know the exact location of non-functional streetlights in their areas of responsibility. A solution may be sought from students through this hackathon regarding an automated feedback system.""",Software,ST888,31,Miscellaneous
National Institute of Design Madhya Pradesh,Scarcity of water in hilly areas during summer months.,"""One of the major problems being faced in hill areas is severe scarcity of water during the summer months. Places, which are located in higher reaches and have witnessed rapid increase in population in the last few years often have to face severe shortage of water during summer months. At most places, water supply is received from natural underground water systems. With rapid urbanisation resulting in an increase in concrete surfaces, the water infiltration into ground during the rainy season has considerably decreased over the years. Thus, the natural sources often become insufficient to support the population, which is dependent on them. Large water tanks are often built in these places, where water is pumped from lower areas which are close to a river, lake etc. Water harvesting in these areas is a difficult task due to the rocky surface and restrictions related to blasting etc. A solution may be sought from students through this hackathon to solve the water problem.""",Hardware,ST889,55,Renewable / Sustainable Energy
National Institute of Design Madhya Pradesh,Insufficient medical support system and remote villages in hill areas,"""In the last two decades, there has been rapid migration of the young population from the remote villages in hilly areas to medium and large cities. Consequently, majority of the population in these villages comprises women and old people. Some of these villages are yet to be connected by road and thus do not have even basic health support system. A good health facility having presence of a doctor is sometimes more than 25 km away, which is inconvenient considering that some of the old people are not able to travel large distances. The problem is compounded by the fact that hill areas have severe shortage of doctors. Visits to these villages by health workers remain largely on paper and little meaningful medical support is currently being provided to these old people. During the outbreak of the second wave of COVID 19, people living in some of these areas also contacted the virus. However, there was hardly any medical aid available.

National Institute of Design Madhya Pradesh,App/portal for tracking/finding of missing persons/children by use of Aadhaar enabled Biometric details:,"""Human trafficking has become a serious global issue of unforeseen proportions of the twenty- first century. By its nature of exploitation, human trafficking has also been increasingly referred to as “modern-day slavery”, and this has prompted rapid proliferation of international, regional, and national anti- trafficking laws, and inspired states to devote enormous financial and bureaucratic resources to its eradication. The Constitution of India, general criminal laws and special laws prohibits and criminalises human trafficking. Article 23 of the constitution of India prohibits trafficking in human being and other similar forms of force labour and pronounce that such acts are offences punishable in accordance with law. Article 24 of the constitution also provides that no child, below the age of 14 years, shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment. It is further provided by the article 37 of the constitution that the state shall direct its policy towards securing that child are given adequate opportunities and facilities to develop in a healthy manner, so that children and the youths are protected against such exploitation. Besides IPC, the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act, 1956, Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, the draft Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection, and Rehabilitation) Draft Bill, 2021 are some of the important mechanisms for combating human trafficking. To combat the human trafficking specially child trafficking, an app or government portal linked with Aadhaar biometric information system may be conceptualized for integration of information. The Aadhar enabled data of missing person like photo, age, figure prints may be circulated to all state and district level police authorities through the dedicated portal with limited access to the authorized authorities only. This information may be used by the designated authorities for the search of the missing persons in locality under their jurisdiction. This would help the Police authorities to find the missing persons in their localities with authenticated and integrated information system. Similarly, the address and contact details of parents or relatives can be found by using the Aadhar enabled integrated information system, so created, for the person found by the Police authorities or civil society specially for the children who do not have proper/adequate information for their address/parents.

National Institute of Design Madhya Pradesh,"""Application based solution for tracking and creating information system for Overloaded Commercial vehicles.""","""Overloading on highways and roads is a serious issue in India, as well as in other developing countries of the world. Although the phenomenon of overloading is not new, so far not much discussion has been done on vehicle overloading in developing countries. It is estimated that about over 50% of commercial vehicles plying on India's national highways and state highways are overloaded. This is particularly serious in the vicinity of mining areas. The legal axle load limits and gross vehicle weight limits are overlooked and violated by the transporters. The problems resulting from overloading are manifold. Newly constructed roads experience accelerated loading conditions resulting in loading to exceed the limits much before their design life is over. This results in premature failure of roads. The maintenance aspect also becomes tricky due to this factor with the consequent fallout as poor condition of roads or heavy maintenance cost required to keep them in shape. Other negative effects of overloading include increased incidences of road accidents, damage to vehicles, lower speeds and inefficiency, delays to vehicular traffic and congestion. Overloading of vehicles is not only detrimental to the economic life of the highways and the roads on which the mechanical vehicles ply but more importantly also leads to larger safety related issues. Hence, there is an urgent need to spread awareness and alarming message to curb this practice. Together with this, methods have to be put in place to identify and catch overloaded vehicles and take strict actions, including heavy penalties and seizure of vehicles. Recently, the Government has mandated the use of Fastag for payment toll collection at all National Highways. Similarly, A mechanism can be developed by installation of electronic weighing machines at all toll plazas on National Highways to prevent and detect overloading of commercial goods transport vehicles. These automated electronic weighing machines would weigh the load of the vehicles and send the recorded reading/information to the toll booth along with fastag details of the vehicle so weighed. The information may be shared with the next toll booth at the highways where the penalties, if any, would levied and deducted from the Fastag balance of the Vehicle. The integrated data of the vehicles can also be collected and maintained for getting the details of vehicle which are usually involve in overloading. The toll plazas are connected with network and are able to exchange vital information about the overloaded vehicles. Application of such methods poses challenges, but output of such methods will be worth the efforts. Participants may identify/analyse the problem in detail and propose the solution by developing AI/ML based software/algorithm or conceptualization of idea for problem solution.""",Software,ST892,17,Smart Automation

NAAC accreditation identifies the quality of the institute in terms of its education, research, faculty, infrastructure, etc., as well as giving students confidence that they are selecting a quality institution. It gives an institute instant credibility and increases its admissions.The quantitative metrics are sample units of measurements which are done in the evaluation of universities in the Assessment and Accreditation process. The present validation mainly is meant for Quantitative 70% data. The data submitted by institutions is backed up by detailed information in the form of data templates. The validation set of rules and suggestive list of documents are developed in the form of SOP’s on the basis of which third party agency verifies and validate the claims on the data submitted for assessment and accreditation. Process involves multiple levels of verification the time duration involved to complete the DVV process is considerably more. Agencies presently also validate data from other sources such as AISHE, UGC, Funding agencies as well as institutional website. The present process of assessment and Accreditation is a benchmark driven ICT enabled process which involves the following steps 1. Registration: Higher Education Institution (HEI) applying for NAAC Assessment and Accreditation (A&A) process need to register themselves first. Those HEI who have not register on or after July 5th 2017 have to register themselves first through Apply Online Tab available on NAAC portal. 2. IIQA: Eligible HEIs seeking A&A are required to submit Institutional Information for Quality Assessment (IIQA) Online. Duly filled in IIQAs of eligible HEIs will be accepted by NAAC for further processing and others will be rejected. 3. SSR: After the acceptance of IIQA, the institution will be asked to fill the SSR with the required document to be uploaded in the portal of NAAC website within 45 days. The SSR of the HEI will then be subjected to further process. The SSR comprises both Qualitative and Quantitative metrics. The Quantitative Metrics (QnM) add up to about 70% and the remaining about 30% are Qualitative Metrics 4. DVV: The data submitted on Quantitative Metrics (QnM) will be subjected to validation exercise with the help of independent Data Validation and Verification (DVV) process as per the guidelines of NAAC Pre-qualifier: The Quantitative Metrics (QnM) which is constitutes about 70% of SSR will be sent for Data Validation and Verification (DVV) Process. HEI that clears the DVV process will proceed for Peer Team Visit with a condition of a Pre-qualifier, that the HEI should score at least 25% in Quantitative Metrics (QnM) as per the final score after the DVV Process. If the HEI does not clear the Pre-qualifier stage then they will have to apply afresh by submitting the IIQA and its fees. Such HEIs are eligible to apply again only after six months from the day of declaration of Pre-qualification status. 5. Student Satisfaction Survey (SSS): SSS will be conducted simultaneously with DVV process. Peer Team visit: After the DVV process, NAAC will intimate the HEI, within 10 days stating that they have successfully cleared the Pre-qualifier. This indicates that the institution has entered the next round of assessment to be done by the Peer Team during their on-site visit. The focus of Peer Team visit will be on the 30% Qualitative Metrics (QlM.

Background- Inscriptions are a great source to look back to ancient history and learn from it, discover truths and may be secrets of life. Apart from the inscriptions in the country, there are inscriptions in Sri Lanka and South East Asia, where we can find abundant inscriptions in local languages, Sanskrit and Tamil. These inscriptions were mainly inscribed to propagate the orders of the rulers and to proclaim the grants and also other social activities.

For example, Tamil language inscriptions had been inscribed in Tamil Vattelluthu, Archiac Vatteluthu, Tamil Pandya Grantha, Tamil Pallava Grantha, and later period Tamil letters which itself have a few varieties, at different period of time. In the same way, inscriptions in Sanskrit languages are inscribed not only in Nagari, Sarada, Mythili, Gaudiya and Deva Nagari scripts but also in local scripts.

To gain insights in all areas such as politics, social values, economic and judicial records and approaches inscriptions are invaluable for an unbiased study of history and psychology. Many of the inscriptions are couched in extravagant language but when the information gained from inscriptions can be corroborated with information from other sources such as still existing monuments or ruins, inscriptions provide insight into India's dynastic history that otherwise lacks contemporary historical records. Relevance/Detailed Description Of the 1,00,000 inscriptions found by the Archaeological Survey of India, about 85% were found in South India and attempts are made to preserve and read them. The fact that they are carved in old scripts such as Prakrit, Sanskrit, Brahmi makes it difficult to understand and reach to the new generations in India, hence, newer ways of understanding and converting them in easy interpretable formats such as Devanagari script is utmost important. Objectives Epigraphical studies about ancient Indian Inscriptions must be made much smoother, interesting and insightful. Most appealing form of capturing the hidden meaning in these inscriptions, is to recognize them optically and deduce the inscripted messages into most commonly understandable scripts such as Devanagari. Devanagari is the widely used lipi or script that can be used as a result of OCR done on the images captured of these monuments with inscriptions. Further the objective is to come up with ways and means to make meaningful digital application/s that can use this information and generate knowledge, spread massive awareness, and support cultural and ancient wisdom upliftment and enrich understanding of Indian history and culture. The objective of this problem statement solution is also to come up with innovative solution which can use OCR techniques to transform inscriptions into meanings using easy Devanagari script and scales to reach to the common man in the country.""",Software,AD973,6,Heritage & Culture
"Indian Knowledge System (IKS), All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)",Real time translations for regional languages,"""When a culturally diverse country like India is working on common goals yet preserving the local languages and cultures at regional level, sometimes communicating across, and communicating together in multiple languages over virtual medium becomes a hurdle while progressing, due to the very reason of not knowing other regional languages. This creates blocks and slows down the progress, apart from creating misunderstandings and inefficient use of time. Background- The Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution lists 22 languages, which have been referred to as scheduled languages and given recognition, status and official encouragement. According to the Census of India of 2001, India has 122 major languages and 1599 other languages. However, figures from other sources vary, primarily due to differences in definition of the terms """"language"""" and """"dialect"""". The 2001 Census recorded 30 languages which were spoken by more than a million native speakers and 122 which were spoken by more than 10,000 people While newer challenges India is facing in the areas of agriculture, environmental imbalances, cultural brain drains, political instability and the most recent pandemic affects, it is most important to come together to brainstorm and work on solutions collaboratively, come up with PAN India communication solution irrespective of language and culture differences. Giant Indian industries having widespread operations across Indian geography attract local talent, however making them communicate and collaborate to resolve issues. With people working on better opportunities, but across their regional periphery, makes them uncomfortable and less productive sometimes. Thus, communication now needs to be faster and seamless despite members lack cross language communication skills. Indian government is also working on a technology that can translate in real-time various vernacular Indian languages to enable the exchange of communications between two persons not speaking the same language. This will bridge boundaries and make us progress. Relevance/Detailed Description As we know, the recent pandemic has forced us adopt newer ways of working and world has come closer. As much as communicating in foreign language is difficult for an individual in India to work with a team member in China region (who mostly prefers to talk in Chinese) Or a German colleague (who use their native language to the fullest), it also becomes a barrier for an Indian person or citizen to interact with other people from different Indian States speaking different and unknown language. In such a situation, for ex. when a Maharashtrian person needs to share the information from the ancient Indian literature in Maharashtrian texts in his/her respective regional language with the other person from Bengal or Andhra Pradesh, he or she may pose a hurdle in the work, if he/she lacks the language skills. There arises a need to support agile communication in different languages seamlessly without having to bother about the language expertise. This necessitates need to develop a solution by means of which we can achieve real time translation of one language into another. The real time means, on the fly translation as one speaks. Our prime minister Shri. Narendra Modi has chosen his speech language as “Hindi” no matter which country he speaks. This one example necessitates an efficient real time language translation system that makes the message reach the world in each of the member’s preferred language. Language as a barrier is to be swept and communications need to be more inclusive and seamless with the use of digital technology – is what Government of India is striving to achieve in coming few years (Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology declared recently). Objectives Develop a technology that enables Real-Time translations of regional languages and hence language doesn’t become barrier between interpersonal, social or corporate communication. Further the objective is to come up with ways and means to make meaningful digital application/s that can use this technology and generate feature-rich application that applies at one or more scenarios and helps businesses. The objective of this problem statement resolution is also to come up with innovative application, service and/or integration which can convert one language speech into another on the fly using comprehensive Artificial Intelligence algorithms and deliver end to end solution.""",Software,AD974,8,Heritage & Culture
"Indian Knowledge System (IKS), All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)","Search Engine for Vedas ,related text words.","""Indian history dates to the life when Vedic and other ancient Indian literature guided mankind to live life in a way to achieve the ultimate. The knowledge in Vedas and related texts includes numerous principles which are useful and relevant even today. This documentation is vast and there is a need of a search engine that can be used to find the similar words, texts in this ocean of literature. Background- The word ‘Veda’ means ‘knowledge’ and is derived from the Sanskrit root ‘vid’, means ‘to know’. It does not refer to one single literary work, but indicates a huge corpus of literature, which arose in the course of many centuries and has been handed down from one generation to another generation by verbal transmission. According to Indian traditional thoughts ‘Veda’ is regarded as revealed scripture, self-evident, and self-authoritative. It is not composed by any human authors. The Vedic hymns (Suktas) or verses (Mantras) are seen and only spoken by the seers (Rishis). These seers are neither author of the Mantras nor are they responsible for the contents of the Mantras. Yaska, the oldest expositor of Veda, has distinctly said that these seers received the sacred knowledge or knowledge was revealed to them. They then handed it down to descendants by oral instruction. The significance of the Veda is manifold. It has been universally acknowledged that the Veda is the earliest available literature of humanity. The Veda in the form of prose and poetry in Sanskrit language, has been regarded as authoritative knowledge. Its authority seems to have remained unquestioned for several millennia, and it has been considered the last tribunal in matters of dispute whether in religion or philosophy or social customs. There are four Vedas that govern a person’s life and values, so that she/he lives peacefully starting from the birth until the death. Guidance in vedas would lead the person to think holistically and tune lifeline according to tatvas (principles) given in all the vedas namely the Rigveda, the Yajurveda, the Samaveda and the Atharvaveda. Holy hymns and Sanskrit mantras described in Vedas are life’s ultimate meanings. The Rigveda Samhita is the oldest extant Indic text. It is a collection of 1,028 Vedic Sanskrit hymns and 10,600 verses in all, organized into ten books (Sanskrit: mandalas). The hymns are dedicated to Rigvedic deities. While India has history of establishment of Vedas, due to its rich philosophy, world acknowledged and started adopting Sanskrit studies and Vedabhyasa. Relevance/Detailed Description There are similarities between the mythology, rituals, and linguistics in Rigveda and those found in ancient central Asia, Iranian and Hindukush (Afghanistan) region. The study of Sanskrit in the West began in the 17th century. In the early 19th century, Arthur Schopenhauer drew attention to Vedic texts, specifically the Upanishads. The importance of Vedic Sanskrit for Indo-European studies was also recognized in the early 19th century. English translations of the Samhitas were published in the later 19th century, in the Sacred Books of the East series edited by Müller between 1879 and 1910. Ralph T. H. Griffith also presented English translations of the four Samhitas, published 1889 to 1899. Rigveda manuscripts were selected for inscription in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2007. This increases the responsibility of India to preserve Vedic knowledge that’s laid down by the ancestors and transmit them to the next generations and to the outer world. This means to search for Vedic hymns, chants, scripts from all avenues effectively, a well-designed system needs to be established. Objectives Develop a search engine which effectively searches words in Vedic literature. For ex: If we search a word ‘Indra’, it should search all the hyms and bring out all the suktas related with Indra or all the mantras that include the word Indra. Also, this engine is required to sort all the Suktas, Mantras, Mandalas, Kandas etc. in the Vedas or related texts as per the desired words entered into the engine. Further the objective is to come up with ways and means to make meaningful digital application/s that can use this search engine and generate feature-rich application that applies at one or more scenarios and helps us build Vedic database subject wise. The objective of this problem statement resolution is also to come up with an innovative application, service and/or integration which can help support spread of Vedic knowledge in new generations using comprehensive Artificial Intelligence algorithms and deliver end to end solution.""",Software,AD975,12,Heritage & Culture

India has committed to be Net Zero by 2070 with various short-term goals including: Reaching a non-fossil fuel energy capacity of 500 GW by 2030. Fulfilling 50 percent energy requirements via renewable energy by 2030 Reducing CO2 emissions by 1 million tons by 2030; and Reducing carbon intensity below 45 percent by 2030. India’s climate change targets are laudable and put the ball firmly in the court of the already rich world to now show that they mean business. This is because, India has not been a historical contributer to the greenhouse gas emissions — from 1870 to 2019, its emissions have added up to a miniscule 4 per cent of the global total. It is lambasted as the world’s third highest polluter in 2019, but its scale of emissions, 2.88 CO2 gigatonnes (Gt). And, we have a huge need to grow our economy and to meet the energy needs of millions of our people. So, from every angle, we did not have to take these global targets to reduce our carbon emissions. This is why, it is not just a challenge to achieve for India but also a challenge for the world to follow suit. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global CO2 emissions must be 18.22 Gt in 2030 for the world to stay below 1.5°C rise in temperature. If we take the global population in 2030 and divide this amount, it would mean that the entire world has to be 2.14 tonnes per capita of CO2 in 2030.

Tourism is not a traditional sector in the System of National Accounts and as a result no country possesses comprehensive national statistics on the energy demand or emissions specifically resulting from tourism. But tourism activity can leave behind a massive amount of carbon footprint. This carbon emissions come from transport, hotels, exploring activities and various other methods where there is a need to move around and explore new places.

Climate change problems have become a worldwide concern. It has become a global consensus to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and actively respond to climate change. The tourism carbon footprint can be used to obtain the carbon dioxide content consumed by tourism in a certain area during a certain period. Between 2009 and 2013, the global carbon footprint of the tourism industry increased from 3.9 to 4.5 GtCO2e, four times the previous estimate, accounting for approximately 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

It is the third-largest export category (after fuels and chemicals) and in 2019 accounted for 7% of global trade. For some countries, it can represent over 20% of their GDP and, overall, it is the third largest export sector of the global economy. Natural disasters have a catastrophic impact on the lives of humans, interrupting their social and economic activities to a great extent. Communities that are located in high-risk regions encounter greater challenges in developing a resilient and sustainable tourism economy. The past examples of tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions all over the world have shown that there are two sides of the issue in terms of tourism sector. First, the devastating effects of the natural disaster slow down the tourism sector like all other activities in a particular destination. On the other hand, the natural disasters are capable of fostering the strong feelings of solidarity luring the global interest to the region for further economic opportunities, including tourism. Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, impacting economies, livelihoods, public services and opportunities on all continents. All parts of its vast value-chain have been affected. As countries gradually lift travel restrictions and tourism slowly restarts in many parts of the world, health must continue to be a priority and coordinated heath protocols that protect workers, communities and travellers, while supporting companies and workers, must be firmly in place. Only through collective action and international cooperation will we be able to transform tourism, advance its contribution. We are stronger together. A roadmap to transform tourism needs to address five priority areas. Mitigate socio-economic impacts on livelihoods, particularly women’s employment and economic security. Boost competitiveness and build resilience, including through economic diversification, with promotion of domestic and regional tourism where possible, and facilitation of conducive business environment for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Advance innovation and digital transformation of tourism, including promotion of innovation and investment in digital skills, particularly for workers temporarily without jobs and for job seekers. Foster sustainability and green growth to shift towards a resilient, competitive, resource efficient and carbon-neutral tourism sector. Green investments for recovery could target protected areas, renewable energy, smart buildings and the circular economy, among other opportunities. Coordination and partnerships to restart and transform sector towards achieving SDGs, ensuring tourism’s restart and recovery puts people first and work together to ease and lift travel restrictions in a responsible and coordinated manner.[UNWTO].

Because it underscores the entire reason why marketers market: to build relationships with customers that will ensure they choose you over the competition, enjoy and benefit from your product or service, keep coming back for more, and tell their friends, family or colleagues to try it too. In order to acquire, convert, retain customers – and turn them into advocates – you need to engage them. To connect with them in an appropriate, effective and meaningful way.

Pumped storage is well established. Other megawatt-scale technologies are being developed. These can provide dispatchable capacity as required by demand. The storage to complement intermittent renewables if they are to replace base-load capacity must be able to meet demand over many days, not simply hours. At household level, behind the meter, battery storage is being promoted to complement solar PV installation. It reduces demand on the grid during evening peaks especially.The rapid increase in many parts of the world of generating capacity by intermittent renewable energy sources, notably wind and solar, has led to a strong incentive to develop energy storage for electricity on a large scale. Due to the (desired or imposed) growing annual share of electrical energy originating from renewable technologies subject to naturally-fluctuating power flows (like solar PV and wind), characterised by relatively low load factors, the combined installed capacities of those technologies in the future are expected to be much larger than typical/conventional electrical peak power demand.",Hardware,TK1045,53,Renewable / Sustainable Energy

In rural areas, the provision of utilities to drain sewage in a safe way lags behind the provision of water for household activities, including drinking water. This creates severe contamination to the environment of the various villages and reduces the impact of water on the improvement of health. Since the water supply for domestic purposes in rural areas has improved considerably over the years, the quantity of wastewater that is disposed has also increased. Hence, effective wastewater management systems need to be introduced in the rural areas to mitigate the problem of contamination.Wastewater treatment is interconnected with the water chain, and thus affects the environment. Water used by rural homes gets converted to sewage or gets contaminated chemicals and other pollutants. It must be treated before it is released back to the environment. While nature is able to process and cope with a small amount of wastewater, imagine the huge volume produced every day before being released back to the environment. Health and environment are two major reasons to have an urgent focus in this soft-neglected area: health. A contaminated water chain can have disastrous effects on human health, agriculture, marine life, wildlife, and our food chain, to name a few.The aim is to identify and innovate a process of managing and treating waste water in the rural areas and to be able to reduce the wastage and improve the reusability of the water by treating it.""",Hardware,TK1049,69,"Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development"

There are many reasons for false alarms to occur. The consequence of a false alarm, in addition to an unjustified fright for its owners, comes in the form of unnecessary notices to the state security forces or to the security company’s security guards, if applicable. The system is activated as if there had been an intrusion that does not really exist. Why is it important to stop false alarms? Stopping false alarms is important so as not to cause unnecessary warnings to the owners, the police or the surveillance company. When false alarms are continuous it can also cause an unwanted effect: we relax and do not give importance to the true alarm when it occurs. An excess of false alarms in a device can cause its cancellation so that it does not interfere with the security system until corrective maintenance of the device is applied. The false alarm may be masking a malfunction of the security system that can have serious consequences when necessary.

The quality and efficiency of logistics services can matter for international trade as a weak logistics infrastructure and operational processes can be a major obstacle to global trade integration. Transport and logistics is a sector in which global value chains (GVCs) play a vital role in connecting countries, spreading technology, and promoting best practice around the world. The transport and logistics GVC is notable for the variety of lead firms involved in it—including major shipping, express delivery, and freight forwarding firms—and the range of local operators they partner with. Increasingly, transport and logistics GVCs are extending their reach into developing countries. The fragmented market of freight transportation imposes several inefficiency costs as a result of delay, double-spending, disputes, and cancellations. While in such competitive market, every player seeks its own profit, optimisation at individual level also becomes harder due to invisibility and disconnectivity. Although tackling some of these issues are doable by synchronization, encryption and integration, it seems that other emerging technologies can also be applied for finding and developing a solution. Logistic companies face few major problems during delivery service. First of all, is dependence on a middleman, which connects messengers and clients, and process all the information for delivery manually, moreover increasing the price for delivery. Second, the utilization of Big Data. Many deliveries and logistics companies don’t use the data that they have, cannot set up new settings and offers for their users. Third, up to 30% of all products ordered online become returns, placing an insurmountable burden on reverse logistics.

While this scenario may seem extreme, it’s a reality for the many employees around the world who must attempt to learn in a non-native language. The world is growing more interconnected and mobile by the day: more companies are opening operations and branches in various locations around the world, creating an increasing need to co-ordinate and communicate transnationally. That poses a full gamut of tricky issues. Take language barriers: colleagues living in different counties might not necessarily speak the same language – and linguistic misunderstandings can have costly consequences. Already in 2012, a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit found that half of 572 executives polled by the organisation thought that uncertainties with language and “messages lost in translation” had negatively impacted their business by hampering international deals. And that is just one barrier to communication. A range of other hurdles are also emerging as key challenges, including cultural barriers, accessibility issues, and outdated technological tools that hamper the beneficial exchange of information, when they are actually supposed to aid it.

Suggest a mechanism to filter the spoofed email at server only.,"""Email spoofing is a form of cyber attack in which a hacker sends an email that has been manipulated to seem as if it originated from a trusted source. This kind of identity deception is widely used in phishing and spam attacks to help boost the open rate and efficacy of malicious emails. In many email attacks, embedded links lead to phishing sites designed to swipe sensitive information or login credentials from recipients. Others contain malware-laden attachments, or employ social engineering to bamboozle well-researched targets out of money in spear-phishing or business email compromise (BEC) scams. In order to spoof an email, all a fraudster needs to do is set up or compromise an SMTP server. From there, they can manipulate the ‘From’, ‘Reply-To’, and ‘Return-Path’ email addresses to make their phishing emails appear to be legitimate messages from the individual or brand they’re impersonating. This identity deception is made possible by the fact that SMTP—the Simple Message Transfer Protocol used by email systems to send, receive, or relay outgoing emails—lacks a mechanism for authenticating email addresses. It’s also exacerbated when exploited through popular cloud-based email platforms such as Gmail and Office 365. Because of their ubiquity and the precipitous volume of emails distributed by these and other email platforms, phishing attacks launched from cloud email accounts are far less likely to be detected and blocked than those sent from a lookalike domain.

"Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways",Lack of uniform GIS system at Ports,"""All major ports in India have implemented GIS in their individual capacities and have mapped either wholly or partially their physical and land assets on GIS through the on boarded vendor. These GIS systems work in siloes with no interconnection across systems. The mapping of the land area and assets enables efficient utilisation and transparency from the governance perspective. The mapping also helps clear ownership of land between ports and municipalities. Bringing a uniform GIS across all major ports will help in centralised view and control of assets and effective monetization of available resources. The system can help map the leased area and also monitor the lease and Minimum Guarantee Throughput from the tenant. The system can also offer a user facing portal for providing facility of online viewing and booking of port land for lease. Challenges that can be faced with centralised implementation can be related to the time of implementation of GIS at ports. With some ports having implemented the systems in later period, their contracts with the GIS implementation agency would still be valid for some time. It would not seem beneficial to replace the systems at a young age and venture into new implementation and premature capital expenditure. On the other hand, for ports that are towards the end of their contract with the implementation agency can be part of the central GIS implementation.""",Software,AK1142,5,Transportation & Logistics

Since the port sector is a very competitive sector, the principle of ""winner takes all"" applies here. Whoever is left behind actually suffers a great loss. Therefore, it is necessary for the government sector to adopt the technology swiftly. The task of technology adoption is very cumbersome for regular management, which is very engrossed with day to-day work and same is unable to take much time and effort for this. In this context, can a mechanism be created that can suggest the emerging technologies with use cases in different sectors to different governments institutions?

"Startup India Section, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIT), Ministry of Commerce and Industry.",Shared usage of workshops and labs by all Educational Institutions at National Level,"Description: Presently each educational Institution has its workshops and labs that are utilized by the students of that specific Institution. In Covid scenario, students are primarily studying in online mode and even if some workshop/ lab based on courses are conducted on campus, its optional for the students to join on campus and due to personal reasons and impact of covid on families, some students study in online mode. For education like Design education and other workshop/ lab-based education, students need these facilities to work on their assignments and projects. To facilitate students to utilize the facilities of Institutions closer to their hometowns, a collective database could be prepared for such facilities. These could be booked by studentsfor specific job works and duration through their Institutions and with prior approvals. Each Institution may specify financial charges for such facilities, which may be paid by the parent Institutions or students themselves depending on the scenario whether for the specific job work, parent Institution had to provide the facility to the student or not. Payment terms for a Security Amount and the charges for usage could be specified by each Institution. This could be planned and implemented through a web-based portal. Such a solution would lead to more judicious utilization of resources and assets at national level and would benefit students staying across the country.

"Department of Food & Public Distribution, Ministry of Consumer Affairs Food and Public Distribution","""Scientific method for determining age Agriculture and Food & of boiled rice ""","""Innovative theme Developing a method to determine age of boiled rice at the time of procurement Current Status Every year about 550 Lakh Metric Tonnes (LMT) rice is procured for the central pool out of which about 175 LMT is boiled rice. There have been some instances where unscrupulous elements tried to push old boiled rice, sourced from the market as freshly milled rice into the system. It has significant cost as well as social implications as government is making payments based on the Minimum Support Price (MSP) to help the farmers and the operations should not be allowed to be misused by vested interests. Similarly, it has to be ensured that the beneficiaries of Public Distribution System (PDS) should be provided with good quality food grains. Pain Points As boiled rice cannot be distinguished as old or new merely on the basis of appearance, a scientific methodology - either based on machine or chemical testing - needs to be developed. Desired State A simple, easy to use testing method for determination of age of boiled rice at the time of procurement can address the issue of recycling of rice. The solution should be able to distinguish between freshly milled boiled rice from rice which was milled earlier, say about 3 months or more. As procurement is time bound and happens concurrently across the country, the testing time as well as portability of the solution is very important. Since the testing will be done at field level, the distinguishing characteristics should be conspicuous, leaving no room for subjectivity and should be cost effective. Background Already there is a chemical-based colour indicator test available for testing the age of raw rice based on the principle of estimating the quantum of released acids in left over bran layers of the grain during storage. However, boiled rice was found to be non-responsive to this test perhaps because the bio chemical composition of par boiled rice and its response to the ambient conditions is different from that of raw rice. Hence a scientific method using chemical/reagents or specifically designed machines may be required to be developed to address this challenge. FCI can provide age wise type samples of boiled rice. Advantages a) Identification of age of boiled rice stocks at the time of procurement will help in controlling the malpractices of pushing older rice into the procurement system b) It will help in better targeting of food security.

GE Healthcare,Design and develop a wireless pod and disposable patch that is gentler on a newborn’s fragile skin and allow for more skin-to-skin contact with the parent.,"Background: Around 10% of newborn infants require assistance during transition after birth. Vital parameters are the most important clinical indicator to evaluate the clinical status of a newborn. One of the major problems in current scenario is that mass of cords connected to a neonate in NICU are most of the times heavier than the neonate itself. Even though these multiple parameters are monitored in NICU, there is no intelligence that draws a correlation between them. Studies have shown that by studying the dependencies of multiple vital parameters analysis can be drawn up to a great extent to predict the neonate’s future health conditions. The proposed solution should consist of : (for more details, refer slide 5 - Proposed Solution) Study and Determine neonate’s Chest & Feet positions where maximum and the most accurate readings can be obtained. Design a system with a unique POD and 3 disposable patch variants (based on the above point’s outcome). The POD should have in-built sensors. Design a Communication module and battery management system (a long battery life). Design patch based on the clinical & user’s needs. The size and weight of the pod should be designed in such a way as no to burden the neonate (unprecedented comfort).
